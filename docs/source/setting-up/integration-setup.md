## ha-bluecurrent

A new repo called ha-bluecurrent was added because the pr to the official Home Assistant repo is still in the review phase.

With this repo the integration could be added to Home Assistant with [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/).

Right now the [url](https://github.com/bluecurrent/ha-bluecurrent) of the repo can be added as a custom integration to HACS. In the future it could also be added to hacs itself.

This repo will be deprecated when the integration is fully added official Home Assistant repo.
